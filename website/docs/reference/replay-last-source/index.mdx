# IReplayLastSource

### Types

```ts
interface IReplayLastSourceMethods<GValue> {
  getValue(unsafe?: false): GValue;
  getValue(unsafe: true): GValue | undefined;
}

type IReplayLastSource<GValue, GSource extends ISource<GValue>> =
  Omit<GSource, keyof IReplayLastSourceMethods<GValue>>
  & IReplayLastSourceMethods<GValue>;
```

### Definition

A *ReplayLastSource* is used to store a value and emit it each time we subscribe to it.

This is the perfect candidate if you have to keep the last emitted value.

You can create a *IReplayLastSource* with the function [createReplayLastSource](/docs/reference/create-replay-last-source/).

This is equivalent to the *[BehaviorSubject](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/subject)* if you provide a *MulticastSource*.

#### getValue(...)

Returns the current value stored in this Source.

If the Source is not initialized (no `initialValue`, or `emit(...)` called), then,
if `unsafe` is `false` or `undefined`, an Error will be thrown, as no value exists.
On the contrary, if `unsafe` is `true`, `undefined` will be returned.
