# IReplaySource

### Types

```ts
interface IReplaySourceMethods<GValue> {
  getValues(): readonly GValue[];
}

type IReplaySource<GValue, GSource extends ISource<GValue>> =
  Omit<GSource, keyof IReplaySourceMethods<GValue>>
  & IReplaySourceMethods<GValue>;
```

### Definition

A *ReplaySource* is used to cache many values and emit them each time we subscribe to it.

You can create a *IReplaySource* with the function [createReplaySource](/docs/reference/create-replay-source/).

This is equivalent to the *[ReplaySubject](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/ReplaySubject)* if you provide a *MulticastSource*.
