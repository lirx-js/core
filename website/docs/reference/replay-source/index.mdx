# IReplaySource

### Types

```ts
interface IReplaySourceMethods<GValue> {
  getValues(): readonly GValue[];
}

type IReplaySource<GValue, GSource extends ISource<GValue>> =
  Omit<GSource, keyof IReplaySourceMethods<GValue>>
  & IReplaySourceMethods<GValue>;
```

### Definition

A *ReplaySource* is used to cache many values and emit them each time we subscribe to it.

This is the perfect candidate if you have to replay the values sent by an Observable.

You can create a *IReplaySource* with the function [createReplaySource](/docs/reference/create-replay-source/).

This is equivalent to the *[ReplaySubject](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/ReplaySubject)* if you provide a *MulticastSource*.
