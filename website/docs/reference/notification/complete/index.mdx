# ðŸ„¸ CompleteNotification

### Types

```ts
type ICompleteNotification = INotification<'complete', void>;
```

### Definition

Used to notify of a ***complete*** state. This is used as a replacement of the `complete` *event* of RxJS.

You may use directly the variable `STATIC_COMPLETE_NOTIFICATION`, instead of creating your own `complete` Notification.
