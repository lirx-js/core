# ICompleteNotification

### Types

```ts
type ICompleteNotification = INotification<'complete', void>;
```

### Definition

Used to notify of a ***complete*** state. This is used as a replacement of the `complete` *event* of RxJS.

For performance reasons, you may use directly the variable `STATIC_COMPLETE_NOTIFICATION`, instead of creating your own `complete` Notification.


### Example

#### Emit a single 'complete' Notification

```ts
const subscribe = single(STATIC_COMPLETE_NOTIFICATION);

subscribe((notification) => {
  console.log(notification);
});
```

Output:

```text
{ name: 'complete', value: undefined }
```
