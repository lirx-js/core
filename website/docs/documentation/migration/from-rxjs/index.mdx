# Migrating from RxJS

Migrating from `rxjs` to `@lirx/core` is a great choice if you aim to improve globally your applications:

‚ö° it strongly improves the performances and reduce the overall size.

üìë it comes with a clear documentation, including direct references to the `rxjs`'s equivalent if one exists.
In consequence, you'll never get lost.

ü™Ñ it's simpler by design, and the power of Observable sending data instead of states (no `comeplete` or `error` to manage),
reduces the complexity of some elaborated pipes or aggregators like `switchMap`, `mergeAll`, etc...

Using exclusively `@lirx/core` in replacement of `rxjs` is therefore good option,
especially in new applications.

For already existing applications, we recommend to slowly replace your old `rxjs`'s Observables with the `@lirx/core`'s ones.

This documentation is here to help you in this migration üèóÔ∏è

## Bridge

To convert from the `rxjs`'s Observables to the `@lirx/core`'s one [you can use the bridge](https://github.com/lirx-js/rxjs-bridge).

#### Installation

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install @lirx/rxjs-bridge --save
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @lirx/rxjs-bridge
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The installation requires `rxjs` as a peer dependency.

#### Functions

- [fromRxJS](/docs/reference/from-rxjs/)
- [toRxJS](/docs/reference/to-rxjs/)

I guess they speak for themselves.

## Types

- `rxjs` uses classes, where `@lirx/core` uses functions.
So the class `Observable` becomes the type [IObservable](/docs/reference/observable/) (a function definition).
The same is true for `Observer` => [IObserver](/docs/reference/observer/).
- `rxjs` regroups under the same name (`Operator`), the functions that generate an Observable, and the pipes that chains them
(called `Pipeable Operator`). `@lirx/core` has a specific type for the pipes: [IObservablePipe](/docs/reference/observable-pipe/).

Moreover, `@lirx/core` tries to be more consistent in its naming:

- functions are explicit about what they return. For example, if a function returns an [IObservablePipe](/docs/reference/observable-pipe/), then it will end with `ObservablePipe`.
- it follows the Observable naming convention: a `$` is present at the end of a variable name representing an Observable (ex: `const value$ = of(5);`),
and it extends this rule with `$$` for a function that generates an Observable, and `$$$` for a function that generates an ObservablePipe.

## Creating an Observable

Most functions that create an Observable in `rxjs` have a similar name in `@lirx/core`. Example:

- [of](/docs/reference/of/)
- [fromEventTarget](/docs/reference/from-event-target/)
- [combineLatest](/docs/reference/combine-latest/)
- [interval](/docs/reference/interval/)
- etc...

However, a few may diverge, in their arguments, naming, or internal logic (especially when working with notifications).


## Creating an ObservablePipe

The same is true for the Observable pipes:

- [distinct$$$](/docs/reference/distinct-observable-pipe/)
- [map$$$](/docs/reference/map-observable-pipe/)
- [scan$$$](/docs/reference/scan-observable-pipe/)
- [debounceTime$$$](/docs/reference/debounce-time-observable-pipe/)
- etc...


## Subscription / Unsubscription


To subscribe with `rxjs`, we have to call the `subscribe` method, which returns a Subscription.
Later we can unsubscribe it, using the method `unsubscribe`:

```ts
const subscription = of(1, 2, 3)
 .subscribe((value: number) => {
    console.log(value);
  });

// LATER
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

With `@lirx/core` we just have to call a function, and next call its return:


```ts
const unsubscribe = of(1, 2, 3)
  ((value: number) => {
    console.log(value);
  });

// LATER
unsubscribe();
```

This simple trick allows `@lirx/core` to heavily optimize function calls and code.

## Piping

With `rxjs` we pipe our Observables with the method `pipe`:

```ts
const subscription = of(1, 2, 3)
 .pipe(
   map(String),
   distinct(),
 );
```

With `@lirx/core`, instead of using a method, we'll use the function **[pipe$$](/docs/reference/pipe-observable/)**;

```ts
const subscription = pipe$$(of(1, 2, 3), [
  map$$$(String),
  distinct$$$(),
]);
```

If we only have one pipe, we can even inline it:

```ts
const subscription = map$$(of(1, 2, 3), String);
```

It will improve the performances and bundle size.

## State of the Observable - next, complete and error

The `@lirx/core` Observables don't have a `complete` nor `error` state. Instead, they just send values defined by their type.

This is somehow, like if they were only sending `next`. To send a state, we have to use some [Notifications](/docs/documentation/getting-started/what-is-a-notification/).

## Subject, BehaviorSubject and ReplaySubject

They are replaced by [Sources](/docs/documentation/getting-started/what-is-a-source/):

- Subject: [createMulticastSource](/docs/reference/create-multicast-source/)
- BehaviorSubject: [createMulticastReplayLastSource](/docs/reference/create-multicast-replay-last-source/)
- ReplaySubject: [createMulticastReplaySource](/docs/reference/create-multicast-replay-source/)
