# Migrating from Promise

Promise is the de-facto API to work with async data.
Observables **don't replace them**, but they **cover some specific limits** of the Promises.

We will discuss of these particular use-cases in this tutorial.

### Difference between a Promise and an Observable

First, we need to understand the differences between a Promise and an Observable:

- A Promise sends only **one** value, where an Observable may emit **many values**.
- A Promise canot be **cancelled** (or with special tricks like `AbortSignal`).
But, the Observables are based on a **subscribe/unsubscribe** mechanism, so cancellation is native for them.
- A Promise is executed **immediately**. However, with the Observables we define first the pipeline, and then, by subscribing **later**, we run this pipeline.

So if we're facing one of these limits, then an Observable is the perfect candidate.

### How to represent a Promise with an Observable ?

A Promise has an internal state:
  - `pending`: the Promise is not resolved yet
  - `fulfilled`: the Promise is resolved without error and has a `value`
  - `rejected`: the Promise is rejected with an `error`

However, an Observable may emit **any kind of value**, so to mimic the behaviour of a Promise we will use some **[Notifications](/docs/documentation/getting-started/what-is-a-notification/)**:

- [INextNotification](/docs/reference/next-notification/): used to emit a value
- [ICompleteNotification](/docs/reference/complete-notification/): used to notify of a `complete` state (success/fulfilled)
- [IErrorNotification](/docs/reference/error-notification/): used to notify of an `error` state (rejected)

So to represent a `fulfilled` Promise:

- we have to emit a `next` Notification
- followed by a `complete` one

And to represent a `rejected` Promise:

- we have to emit an `error` Notification

It's a little tricky, so we will see now some examples.

### Observable equivalent of the Promise's methods

#### Promise.resolve

As said earlier, a fulfilled Promise, may be represented by a `next` Notification followed by a `complete` one.

This function has the name of **[singleWithNotifications](/docs/reference/single-with-notifications/)**.

It simply does:

```ts
function singleWithNotifications<GValue>(
  value: GValue,
): IObservable<ISingleObservableNotifications<GValue>> {
  return (emit: IObserver<ISingleObservableNotifications<GValue>>): IUnsubscribe => {
    emit(createNextNotification<GValue>(value));
    emit(STATIC_COMPLETE_NOTIFICATION);
    return noop;
  };
}
```

#### Promise.reject

On another hand, a rejected Promise, may be represented by an `error` Notification.

This time, the function has the name of **[throwError](/docs/reference/throw-error/)**.

And it does:

```ts
function throwError<GError>(
  error: GError,
): IObservable<IErrorNotification<GError>> {
  return (emit: IObserver<IErrorNotification<GError>>): IUnsubscribe => {
    emit(createErrorNotification<GError>(error));
    return noop;
  };
}
```

#### Promise.all

`Promise.all` is used to await all promises to fulfill from a list of promises. If one is rejected, it will reject too.

The Observable's equivalent is [**forkJoin** or allWithNotifications](/docs/reference/fork-join/).

#### Promise.race

`Promise.race` is used to await the first promise to resolve (fulfilled or rejected) from a list of promises.

The Observable's function is: **[raceWithNotifications](/docs/reference/race-with-notifications/)**.

#### Promise.any

`Promise.any` is used to await that one promise fulfills from a list of promises. If all the promises reject, it will reject too.

With Observables: **[anyWithNotifications](/docs/reference/any-with-notifications/)**.


#### Chaining -> then / catch

A key point of Promises is they capability to be chained using the `.then` and `.catch` methods.

##### then

The `.then` method of a Promise accepts two optional/nullable arguments:

- an `onFulfilled` function (called when the Promise is fulfilled)
- and an `onRejected` function (called when the Promise is rejected)

However, the Observables are stricter, and provides distinct functions, for each case:

- `.then(onFulfilled)` or `.then(onFulfilled, null)` : **[fulfilledObservablePipe](/docs/reference/fulfilled-observable-pipe/)**.
- `.catch(onRejected)` or `.then(null, onRejected)`: **[rejectedObservablePipe](/docs/reference/rejected-observable-pipe/)**.
- `.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)`: **[thenObservablePipe](/docs/reference/then-observable-pipe/)**.

##### catch

So the `.catch` method becomes **[rejectedObservablePipe](/docs/reference/rejected-observable-pipe/)**, with Observables.

##### finally

Lastly, the `.finally` method is used to handle fulfilled or rejected states.

With `@lirx/core`, it's called **[finallyObservablePipe](/docs/reference/finally-observable-pipe/)**.

#### Casting an Observable to a Promise

In most cases, we simply want the last received value (last `next` Notification), so we can use the function
**[toPromiseLast](/docs/reference/to-promise-last/)**.
However, sometimes, we want to get all the values as an array. In this case, we can use the function
**[toPromiseAll](/docs/reference/to-promise-all/)**.
.

:::caution

**[toPromise](/docs/reference/to-promise)** **MUST** only be used with Observables **NOT** sending notifications.

### Example

```ts
function noCORS(url: string): string {
  const _url: URL = new URL(`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`);
  _url.pathname = url;
  return _url.href;
}

interface IGeoJSGetGeoJSON {
  organization_name: string;
  region: string;
  accuracy: number;
  asn: number;
  organization: string;
  timezone: string;
  longitude: string;
  country_code3: string;
  area_code: string;
  ip: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  continent_code: string;
  country_code: string;
  latitude: string;
}

// 1) prepare the request pipeline
const request$ = pipe$$(fromFetch(noCORS(`https://get.geojs.io/v1/ip/geo.json`)), [
  fulfilled$$$((response: Response): IObservable<IDefaultNotificationsUnion<IGeoJSGetGeoJSON>> => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return fromPromiseFactory(() => response.json());
    } else {
      return throwError(createNetworkError());
    }
  }),
  fulfilled$$$((data: IGeoJSGetGeoJSON): IObservable<IDefaultNotificationsUnion<string>> => {
    return singleN<string>(data.country);
  }),
]);

const doRequestOnClick$ = pipe$$(fromEventTarget(window, 'click'), [
  switchMap$$$(() => request$),
]);

doRequestOnClick$((notification: IDefaultNotificationsUnion<string>) => {
  console.log(notification.name, notification.value);
});
```

Output:

```text
// user clicks
'next', United States
'complete', undefined
```
