# Naming convention

To keep our dataflow as clear as possible for everyone, it's a **best practice** to apply the following naming convention.

We won't force you to follow strictly this guide, but it's a very efficient way to organize your code.

---

> an Observable ends with $

Example: an Observable from an HTTP request

```ts
const request$ = fromFetch('http://example.com');
```

This is particularly useful to distinguish "sync" variables from "async" ones.

---

> a function that generates an Observable ends with $$

Example: an ObservablePipe converting incoming values to string

```ts
const mapToString$$ = mapObservablePipe(String);

// usage example
const output$ = mapToString$$(input$);
```

Every ObservablePipe enters this category (functions ending with `Observable`).

---

> a function that generates a function returning an Observable ends with $$$

Example: shortcut for the function `mapObservablePipe`

```ts
const map$$$ = mapObservablePipe;

// usage example
const output$ = map$$$(String)(input$);
```

Every function generating an ObservablePipe enters this category (functions ending with `ObservablePipe`).

---

> an Observer starts with $

Example: an Observer for byte data

```ts
const $chunk = (data: Uint8Array) => {
  console.log(data);
};

// usage example
const unsubscribe = chunk$($chunk);
```

We'll use it to distinguish Observers from other callback functions.

---

> a source starts and ends with $

Example: a Source of numbers

```ts
const $count$ = createMulticastReplayLastSource(5);
```

## Alternatives and Inline

During our journey with Observables, we've seen a lot of functions, and it's just the tip of the iceberg.

To keep thinks as clear as possible, `@lirx/core` took the bet to name its functions **explicitly** about what they do and return,
... at the cost of verbose function names.
This is very useful for beginners, however, this is not truly practical when we'll be confident with Reactive Programming,
as **it tends to bloat our code**, and make it less readable.

So we've written **shorter alternatives** to many functions.
These alternatives may be found on top of each documentation of the `@lirx/core`'s functions.

For instance, every function generating an ObservablePipe (functions ending with `ObservablePipe`),
may be replaced with an `$$$` at the end (`[name]ObservablePipe => [name]$$$`).

Examples:

- `mapObservablePipe` => `map$$$`
- `distinctObservablePipe` => `disctinct$$$`
- etc.

Its keeps everything shorter, an easier to read.

Moreover, these function have an **"inline" alternative**.

If we remove the `Pipe` at the end of their name, they accept an Observable as first argument and return another one.

It's a **shorter** and **optimized** version of: `[name]ObservablePipe(...args)(observable)` => `[name]Observable(observable, ...args)`

And, as they follow the Observables naming convention, we may instead write `$$` at the end (`[name]Observable => [name]$$`).

An example is probably clearer:

*the verbose implementation*

```ts
const output$ = pipeObservable(input$, [
  mapObservablePipe(String),
]);
```

*the shorter version*

```ts
const output$ = pipe$$(input$, [
  map$$$(String),
]);
```

*and the inline alternative (recommended)*

```ts
const output$ = map$$(input$, String);
```

When possible, you should strongly consider using the "inline alternative".

---

However, **do not inline**, when you have to chain many ObservablePipes:

*the verbose implementation*

```ts
const output$ = pipeObservable(input$, [
  mapObservablePipe(String),
  filterObservablePipe(_ => _ !== ''),
]);
```

*the shorter version (recommended)*

```ts
const output$ = pipe$$(input$, [
  map$$$(String),
  filter$$$(_ => _ !== ''),
]);
```

*and the inline alternative (abstain)*

```ts
// DON'T inline when you have to chain many ObservablePipes, as it becomes unreadable !
const output$ = filter$$(map$$(input$, String), _ => _ !== '');
```


And voil√† ! You're ready to write concise data flow with Observables.
