# What's next ?

To be efficient with `@lirx/core` (and Reactive Programing in general),
**you will have to take a look at many functions**.
If you **skip** this part, you'll definitively **struggle** with RP.

This may feel like a pain, but it's like any other framework: you'll be more productive if you **take an hour** (or a few) reading the documentation or some tutorials.

`@lirx/core` provides many functions to help you to build and pipe some Observables.
Everytime you face a problem with Observables, **there is probably an existing function** to fix it.
You can find all of them on the **[reference page](../../../reference/observable)**.
