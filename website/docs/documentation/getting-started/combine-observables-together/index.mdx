# Combine Observables

In this part, we'll learn how to combine Observables to create more complex dataflow.

The following examples will group a list Observables,
and will re-emit the values they send differently, according to the selected function.

### Re-emit all values

The simplest combinator of Observable is **[merge](/docs/reference/merge/)**.

It creates an output Observable which concurrently emits all values from every given input Observable.

As an example, we may create an Observable grouping mouse events:

```ts
const onMouseDown$ = fromEventTarget(window, 'mousedown');
const onMouseUp$ = fromEventTarget(window, 'mouseup');

const onMouseDownOrUp$ = merge([
  onMouseDown$,
  onMouseUp$,
]);

onMouseDownOrUp$((event: MouseEvent) => {
  console.log(event.button);
});
// logs the mouse button when down or up
```

However, on real applications, we will not end up using frequently this aggregator.
Instead, we'll mostly use the following function.

### Emit the values in the form of an Array

Usually, when grouping some Observables, we want to get all the last values they sent in the form of an Array,
everytime a change occurs.

This may be done with the function **[combineLatest](/docs/reference/combine-latest/)**.

For example, let's assume we have two Observables containing the firstname and the lastname of a user (ex: coming from two &lt;input&gt; elements),
and we want to display the fullname of this user dynamically.

We may write:

```ts
// to keep it short in this example, the names are built through 'single'
// but in a real case, they could come from two <input>
const firstName$ = single('Richard');
const lastName$ = single('Stallman');

const onNamesChange$ = combineLatest([
  firstName$,
  lastName$,
]);

onNamesChange$(([firstName, lastName]) => {
  console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);
});
// logs 'Richard Stallman'
```

In this example, if any of `firstName$` or `lastName$` changes, then the displayed fullname will change too.


### Aggregates the values

Finally, we'll see how to subscribe to many observables, and when one changes, we can aggregate the values and emit the result.

We may think about strings concatenation, performing a sum, etc.

This function is called **[reactiveFunction](/docs/reference/reactive-function/)**.

If we re-write our previous example:

```ts
const firstName$ = single('Richard');
const lastName$ = single('Stallman');

const fullName$ = reactiveFunction(
  [firstName$, lastName$],
  ([firstName, lastName]) => {
    return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
  },
);

fullName$((fullName: string) => {
  console.log(fullName);
});
// logs 'Richard Stallman'
```
