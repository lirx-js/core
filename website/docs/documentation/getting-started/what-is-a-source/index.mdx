# What is a Source ?

We've seen how to create Observables, but how can we simply emit some values ?

## Definition of a Source

Let's write the interface of a [Source](../../../reference/observer-observable-pair/source/):

```ts
interface ISource<GValue> {
  readonly emit: IObserver<GValue>;
  readonly subscribe: IObservable<GValue>;
}
```

A *Source* is simply a **tuple** composed of an *Observer* and an *Observable*.

Usually, they are tied together by a predefined algorithm.
