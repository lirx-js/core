# What is a Source ?

We've seen how to create Observables, but how can we simply emit some values ?

## Definition of a Source

Let's write the interface of a [Source](/docs/reference/source/):

```ts
interface ISource<GValue> {
  readonly emit: IObserver<GValue>;
  readonly subscribe: IObservable<GValue>;
}
```

A *Source* is simply a **tuple** composed of an *Observer* and an *Observable*.

Usually, they are tied together by a predefined algorithm.


## Kind of Sources

`@lirx/core` comes with a list of predefined Sources, each having a specific usage.

:::note

This part is more difficult than the others, do not focus too much on the details.
You may take a quick look at this section and jump directly to the [conclusion](#let) if required.

### The MulticastSource

A [MulticastSource](/docs/reference/multicast-source/) is used to emit **one value to multiple** Observers.

While plain Observables are unicast (each subscribed Observer owns an independent execution of the Observable),
*MulticastSource* are multicast.

Internally to the MulticastSource, subscribe does not invoke a new execution that delivers values.
It simply registers the given Observer in a list of Observers, similarly to how addListener usually works in other libraries and languages.

You can create a MulticastSource with the function [createMulticastSource](/docs/reference/create-multicast-source/).

Here's a simple example demonstrating its usage .

```ts
const source = createMulticastSource<number>();

source.subscribe((value: string) => {
  console.log('value - A:', value);
});

source.subscribe((value: string) => {
  console.log('value - B:', value);
});

source.emit(1);
source.emit(2);
```

Output:

```text
value - A: 1
value - B: 1
value - A: 2
value - B: 2
```

If we already have an Observable and want to "convert" it to a *MulticastSource* (share its values), we can use the
ObservablePipe [shareObservablePipe](/docs/reference/share-observable-pipe/):

```ts
const subscribe = pipe$$(interval(1000), [
  scan$$$<void, number>(count => (count + 1), 0),
  share$$$<number>(),
]);
```

### The ReplaySource

A [ReplaySource](/docs/reference/replay-source/) **caches all the received values** and emit them each time we subscribe to it.

This is the perfect candidate if we have to replay the values sent by an Observable.

We can create one using the function [createReplaySource](/docs/reference/create-replay-source/),
but usually we'll end up using the shortcut [createMulticastReplaySource](/docs/reference/create-multicast-replay-source/),
or the ObservablePipe [shareObservablePipeWithMulticastReplaySource](/docs/reference/share-observable-pipe-with-multicast-replay-source/).


### The ReplayLastSource

A [ReplayLastSource](/docs/reference/replay-last-source/) is like a ReplaySource, but it only **caches the last received value**.

This is the perfect candidate if we have to keep only the last emitted value.

We can create one using the function [createReplayLastSource](/docs/reference/create-replay-last-source/), but like the previous one,
we'll usually end up using the shortcut **[createMulticastReplayLastSource](/docs/reference/create-multicast-replay-last-source/)**,
or the ObservablePipe [shareObservablePipeWithMulticastReplayLastSource](/docs/reference/share-observable-pipe-with-multicast-replay-last-source/).

## let$$

Sources are a perfect bridge when we have to manually emit some values.

In 99% cases we'll use the shortcut **[let$$](/docs/reference/create-multicast-replay-last-source/)** to create a MulticastReplayLastSource.
And it will act like a regular variable, but having the faculties of an Observable.

```ts
const $firstname$ = let$$<string>();
const $lastname$ = let$$<string>();

const fullname$ = string$$`${$firstname$.subscribe} ${$lastname$.subscribe}`;

fullname$((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});

$firstname$.emit('Valentin');
$lastname$.emit('Richard');
// OUT => Valentin Richard

$firstname$.emit('Bob');
// OUT => Bob Richard
```

This is an elegant manner to create dynamic variables.
