# Pipe Observables

An essential part of Reactive Programing consist of **piping** our Observable.

It brings us the possibility to **transform** multiple values on different steps to build **complex dataflow** in a few lines of code.

For example, we may think of a *pipe* filtering only odd numbers, and another converting incoming numbers to string.

Such a function is called an ObservablePipe.

## Definition of an ObservablePipe

An ObservablePipe is a **transform/modify data function** for Observables.
It usually **subscribes** to the provided Observable, **performs** some operations on the incoming values,
and may **emit** these values or new ones.

Here's the type of an [ObservablePipe](../../../reference/observable-pipe):

```ts
interface IObservablePipe<GIn, GOut> {
  (subscribe: IObservable<GIn>): IObservable<GOut>;
}
```

A *ObservablePipe* is a function that **accepts an *Observable*** as input (the `subscribe` argument), and **returns another
*Observable*** as output. Both are related by an algorithm defined internally into the *ObservablePipe*.

As an example, here's a handmade *ObservablePipe* that emits only distinct received values:


import ObservablePipeExample from './_observable-pipe-example.mdx';

<ObservablePipeExample/>

Then we may use our new *ObservablePipe* like this:

```ts
const distinctValues$ = distinct(observable);
const unsubscribe = distinctValues$(observer);
```

If this looks too complex, don't worry. We **won't have to write** from scratch any of them.
`@lirx/core` comes with a many ObservablePipes, right out of the box.

## Chaining many ObservablePipes

ObservablePipes are made to be chained together to **create complex dataflow**.

An *ObservablePipe* could be used directly like any ordinary functions (`distinct(observable)`), but in practice, there
tend to be many of them convolved together, and quickly become unreadable (`op4(op3(op2(op1(obs))))`).

For that reason, we will use the function **[pipe$$](../../../reference/pipe-observable)**
that accomplishes the same thing while being **much easier to read**:

```ts
pipe$$(obs, [
  op1,
  op2,
  op3,
  op4,
]);
```

This function simply does:

```ts
[op1, op2, op3, op4].reduce((value, fnc) => fnc(value), obs);
```

Moreover, we can group our ObservablePipes too using [pipe$$$](../../../reference/pipe-observable-pipes) (less frequently used).

In the next chapter, we will see some examples.
