# Introduction

⚡️ **@lirx/core** is extremely **[fast and small](/docs/documentation/performances/)**.
Tree-shaking is fully supported, and the library is strongly optimized, so you can embed it in any applications, even the smallest ones.

📨 It helps you to build and compose **asynchronous and event-based programs**.
Everything being asynchronous, like user events, http requests, data streams, is supported out from the box.

🦸 This is your **best ally** when developing a **web-app**.
Code in a more predictable way with **clear data workflows**, avoiding bugs, errors and inconsistent states.

🔥 However, **[learning it is hard](https://dev.to/mfcodeworks/comment/11agc)**, or it may looks like a total waste of time.
But don't give up. Once you'll become a master of Reactive Programming you'll feel like a divinity.

When I started using RxJS, which is the most used Observables library, it was a nightmare:
it lacks of tutorials, the documentation is cryptic, and we can't find concrete use cases and examples.
It's just a pile of documentation where the authors expect that everyone can read their mind 😑.

But now, that I'm very confortable with Reactive Programing, **I simply cannot work without it**:
it solves so many problems and allows me to create very consistent applications.

The first thing to know is that Reactive Programing requires you to **think in reactive**.
Just like Promises on their time (*async thinking*), you'll have to be able to change your vision on variables and streams.

So the first question to answer is: **when should I use an Observable ?**
Well, the best answer is: **everytime you have a value which will evolve through time.**
It may be a user's input, an async http request, a computed value, a stream of data, etc.

If you force yourself to use the Observables when you encounter these situations, then you'll quickly become an Observables' master.

The second and most important point: you'll have to **read the documentation** and learn at least the essentials functions before beginning.
Just like you would have done for a tooling library like *lodash* or *underscore*.
If you skip this step, you won't be able to unleash the true potential of Observables.



## What is Reactive Programming?

> Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams.

Actually, this isn't new:

- Promises are streams of values with a `success` and `error` state, and you can "pipe" them with `then` or `catch`
- EventListeners are streams of events
- Timers (setTimeout/setInterval) are somehow streams of "void/empty" values
- [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)
  and [Readable](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#class-streamreadable) are data streams too
- websockets
- ... and many more...

So, you've probably already played with asynchronous data streams. Reactive programing is all about this but on steroids.
You'll be able to **create data streams of anything**, not just from click and hover events:
variables, user inputs, properties, tasks, data structures,...

On top of that, you are given **an amazing toolbox of functions** to combine, create and filter any of those streams.
That's where the "functional" magic kicks in. A stream can be used as an input to another one. Even multiple streams can be used as inputs
to another stream. You can merge two streams. You can filter a stream to get another one that has only those events you are interested in.
You can map data values from one stream to another new one. Etc.

A stream is simply a sequence of **ongoing values ordered in time**.

We capture these emitted values only **asynchronously**, by defining a function that will execute when a value is emitted.
The "listening" to the stream is called **subscribing**.
The functions we are defining are *Observers*. The stream is the *Observable* being observed.

## Reactive Programming by example

Normally you'll register event listeners like this:

```js
const onClick = () => console.log('clicked');
document.addEventListener('click', onClick);
// later
document.removeEventListener('click', onClick);
```

With `@lirx/core`, instead, you will create an Observable :

```js
const onClick$ = fromEventTarget(document, 'click');
const unsubscribe = onClick$(() => console.log('clicked'));
// later
unsubscribe();
```

The most important part of Reactive Programing, is that you have fine control of the flow of your values.

Let's write a piece of code which displays the number of time the user clicked on the document:

In "plain" js:

```js
let count = 0;
let rate = 1000;
let lastClick = Date.now() - rate;
document.addEventListener('click', () => {
  if (Date.now() - lastClick >= rate) {
    console.log(`clicked ${++count} times`);
    lastClick = Date.now();
  }
});
```

With `@lirx/core`:

```js
const subscribe = pipe$$(fromEventTarget(document, 'click'), [
  throttleTime$$$(1000),
  scan$$$(count => count + 1, 0),
]);
subscribe(count => console.log(`clicked ${count} times`));
```

The code is **more concise, organized, and clearer**.
I hope you enjoy the beauty of this approach.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg: you can apply the same operations on different kinds of streams,
for instance, on a stream of API responses, bytes, timing, etc.; with many other functions available.

## For what usage RP is great ?

Usually, when we use variables and functions, we **PULL** values:

```ts
let firstname = 'Valentin';
let lastname = 'Richard';
const fullname = `${firstname} ${lastname}`; // you 'PULL' the values from 'firstname' and 'lastname' to compute 'fullname'
console.log(fullname); // 'Valentin Richard'
```

But, sometimes (especially in javascript with a lot of async events, or in front-end applications) we have to deal with evolving values:
If we update the value of `firstname` or `lastname` (ex: from an &lt;input&gt; element), we would like to update the value of `fullname` too.

We could write:

```ts
const getFullName = () => `${firstname} ${lastname}`;
console.log(getFullName()); // 'Valentin Richard'
firstname = `Bob`;
console.log(getFullName()); // 'Bob Richard'
```

But we're forced to **PULL** the "fullname" to get the value. It would be more convenient having `fullname`
updating automatically when any of `firstname` or `lastname` changes.

Here comes the Observables:


```ts
const firstname$ = createTextInputObservable('Valentin');
const lastname$ = createTextInputObservable('Richard');
const fullname$ = string$$`${firstname$} ${lastname$}`;

fullname$((fullname) => {
  console.log(fullname);
});
```

If `firstname$` or `lastname$` changes, then `fullname$` is immediately updated.
So Observables **PUSHES** values. We don't have to **PULL** them. It's magic, and it's perfect for all async events.

[You can test this code here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-psdoti?file=index.ts)

> So Reactive Programing is excellent for every asynchronous stream of data.
This includes: computed/updated values, events, promises, timers, and many more.

## Why should you consider adopting RP ?

Reactive Programming raises the level of abstraction of your code, so you can focus on the interdependence of events that define the
business logic, rather than having to constantly fiddle with a large amount of implementation details.
**Code in RP will likely be more concise**.

The benefits are really important in **web applications**, where you have to deal with multitude of UI events, async requests, etc...
and react to these changes, like updating the DOM.
