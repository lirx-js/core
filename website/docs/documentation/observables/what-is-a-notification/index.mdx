# Notification

As you may have noticed so far, the Observables don't have any state like `complete` or `error`.
They are just raw streams of data.

However, some streams have a final state, and we need a way to represent them with Observables.

For example, an HTTP request finishes with a success state (and an associated Response's Body)
or an error state (with an associated error) if it failed.

`@lirx/core` uses [Notifications](/docs/reference/notification/) as a state replacement for Observables.

## Definition of a Notification

```ts
interface INotification<GName extends string, GValue> {
  readonly name: GName;
  readonly value: GValue;
}
```

A Notification is simply a tuple composed of a `name` and a `value`.

You may create one using a plain object or prefer the function **[createNotification](/docs/reference/create-notification/)**.

The three essentials Notifications are:

- [INextNotification](/docs/reference/next-notification/): to emit a value.
- [ICompleteNotification](/docs/reference/complete-notification/): to notify of a 'complete' state.
- [IErrorNotification](/docs/reference/error-notification/): to notify of an 'error' state.

These notifications will be passed as values for our Observables.

An example, is worth a thousand words.

## Example

Let's create an Observable based on a Promise:

- If the Promise fulfills, we will send a `next` Notification containing the Promise's result,
followed by a `complete` one.
- If the Promise rejects,  we will send an `error` Notification containing the Promise's error.


We will start by defining the type of value that our Observable will emit:

```ts
type IObservableFromPromiseNotifications<GValue> =
  | INextNotification<GValue>
  | ICompleteNotification
  | IErrorNotification
  ;
```

It's just a union of different kind of notifications.

Then, we will handle the Promise's result and emit the corresponding Notifications:

```ts
promise.then(
  (value: GValue) => {
    emit(createNextNotification<GValue>(value));
    emit(createCompleteNotification());
  },
  (error: any) => {
    emit(createErrorNotification<any>(error));
  },
);
```

Let's wrap everything in a function:

```ts
function fromPromise<GValue>(
  promise: Promise<GValue>,
): IObservable<IObservableFromPromiseNotifications<GValue>> {
  type GNotificationsUnion = IObservableFromPromiseNotifications<GValue>;
  return (emit: IObserver<GNotificationsUnion>): IUnsubscribe => {
    let running: boolean = true;
    promise.then(
      (value: GValue) => {
        if (running) {
          emit(createNextNotification<GValue>(value));
        }
        if (running) {
          emit(createCompleteNotification());
        }
      },
      (error: any) => {
        if (running) {
          emit(createErrorNotification<any>(error));
        }
      },
    );
    return (): void => {
      running = false;
    };
  };
}
```

And voilÃ  ! We've created an Observable from a Promise ðŸŽŠ.

You may import and use immediately [fromPromise](/docs/reference/from-promise/) and [fromPromiseFactory](/docs/reference/from-promise-factory/)
from `@lirx/core`, instead of re-implementing it.

Now we have to **consume** our Observable:

```ts
const subscribe = fromPromise(Promise.resolve(5));

subscribe((notification: IObservableFromPromiseNotifications<number>) => {
  switch (notification.name) {
    case 'next':
      console.log('next', notification.value);
      break;
    case 'complete':
      console.log('resolved');
      break;
    case 'error':
      console.log('rejected', notification.value);
      break;
  }
});
```

We simply switch on the incoming Notification's name.

We may also use the function [defaultNotificationObserver](/docs/reference/default-notification-observer/) if we prefer a shorter syntax:

```ts
subscribe(
  defaultNotificationObserver(
    /* next */ (value: number) => {
      console.log('next', value);
    },
    /* complete */ () => {
      console.log('resolved');
    },
    /* error */ (error: any) => {
      console.log('rejected', error);
    },
  ),
);
```

## Observables based on Notifications

There are plenty of Observables and ObservablePipes based on Notifications on the **[reference page](/docs/tags/notification/)**.


For example, we could create an Observable from an HTTP request, and then display the result:

```ts
const request$ = pipe$$(fromFetch(`https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/iso_8859-1.txt`), [
  fulfilled$$$((response: Response): IObservable<IFromPromiseObservableNotifications<string>> => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return fromPromise(response.text());
    } else {
      return throwError(createNetworkError());
    }
  }),
]);

toPromiseLast(request$)
  .then((text: string) => {
    console.log(text);
  });
```

**ðŸ˜° Yes, in this case, using Promises is easier and shorter.**

However, with Observables we may create far more powerful data flow - like streaming the response body:

```ts
const request$ = pipe$$(fromFetch(`https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/iso_8859-1.txt`), [
  fulfilled$$$((response: Response): IObservable<IFromPromiseObservableNotifications<string>> => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return fromReadableStream<Uint8Array>(response.body);
    } else {
      return throwError(createNetworkErrorFromResponse(response));
    }
  }),
]);
```

```ts
request$(
  defaultNotificationObserver(
    /* next */ (chunk: Uint8Array) => {
      console.log('chunk', chunk);
    },
    /* complete */ () => {
      console.log('done !');
    },
    /* error */ (error: any) => {
      console.log('something wrong append', error);
    },
  ),
);
```

It's something that can't be done with Promises, but can be done very easily with Observables.

Observables are **extremely powerful**. When you'll master them, we guaranty **you'll do some magic**.

## Comparison with RxJS

> Why @lirx/core's Observables are not based on 'next', 'complete' and 'error' events likes RxJS ?

This choice is due to a simple observation: **most Observables don't have or need a final state**.

They just send raw values, without ever finishing until unsubscribed (ex: `fromEventTarget`, `interval`, etc.).

So `complete` or `error` states are unnecessary in the majority of use cases.

However, the RxJS's Observables are build exclusively on these three "*events*".
It results in tortuous interactions of the data in the pipes,
elaborated state management, and complex algorithms.
All of these **impacts negatively RxJS**: it means more lines of code in the library,
resulting in a bigger bundle size and decreased performances.

Finally, the Observables should not be restricted to these 3 "*events*": we may easily imagine an XHR
Observable emitting `upload-progress` and `download-progress` events. Something impossible with RxJS.

These use cases are perfectly handled with `@lirx/core`, with even faster performances.
Thanks to the Notifications' approach.
