# Basic ObservablePipes

*ObservablePipes* are the most important bricks to build complex data flow with our Observables.

In this tutorial, we'll **learn** how to use some of the **essentials** ObservablePipes provided by `@lirx/core`.

### Filtering and mapping

The most common pipes are [filter$$$](/docs/reference/filter-observable-pipe/), [map$$$](/docs/reference/map-observable-pipe/),
and [distinct$$$](/docs/reference/distinct-observable-pipe/).

For example, we may want to filter only even numbers, and then cast them to string:

```ts
const subscribe = pipe$$(single(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), [
  filter$$$(v => v % 2 === 0),
  map$$$(String),
]);

subscribe((value: string) => {
  console.log(value);
});
```

As you may have already noted, this is quite similar to the `Array.map` and `Array.filter` functions:

```ts
const data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  .filter(v => v % 2 === 0)
  .map(String);

console.log(data);
```



However, it works with streams of data instead of static values.


### Debouncing values

Sometimes, we need to delay incoming values and/or discard next values during a period.

The most common pipes are [debounceTime$$$](/docs/reference/debounce-time-observable-pipe/)
and [throttleTime$$$](/docs/reference/map-observable-pipe/).

As an example, this is especially useful when we want to debounce user's click:

```ts
const subscribe = pipe$$(fromEventTarget(window, 'click'), [
  debounceTime$$$(200),
]);

subscribe(() => {
  console.log('clicked');
});
```

### When an Observable emits a value, map this value and return another Observable

One of the most used pipe is [switchMap$$$](/docs/reference/merge-map-single-observable-pipe/).
It maps the incoming values of an Observable to another one.

For example, it allows us *to listen to an element's size selected by a user click*:

```ts
const subscribe = pipe$$(fromEventTarget(window, 'click'), [
  // maps incoming event to the "select" element using event.target
  map$$$((event: MouseEvent): HTMLElement => event.target as HTMLElement),
  // maps incoming element into an Observable listening to its size
  switchMap$$$((element: HTMLElement): IObservable<DOMRectReadOnly> => {
    // use merge to get the initial size, and the new size if the element is resized
    return merge([
      // initial size
      reference((): DOMRectReadOnly => element.getBoundingClientRect()),
      // listen to the element's size and map the value to get a DOMRectReadOnly
      map$$(fromResizeObserver(event.target), ({ contentRect }) => contentRect),
    ]);
  }),
]);

subscribe(({ width, height }) => {
  console.log(width, height);
});
```

However, it is a little more complex than the previous one. So don't hesitate to play with it.

### Sharing values of an Observable (only subscribing once)

Let's finish with another common use case: if we want to subscribe many times to an Observable but subscribe only once to the original one.
We may use [shareRL$$$](/docs/reference/share-observable-pipe-with-multicast-replay-last-source/).


```ts
const subscribe = pipe$$(interval(1000), [
  scan$$$<void, number>(count => (count + 1), 0),
  shareRL$$$<number>(),
]);

subscribe((value: number) => {
  console.log('value - A:', value);
});

// note that interval(1000) is only subscribed once
subscribe((value: number) => {
  console.log('value - B:', value);
});
```


### Going deeper

Plenty of others *ObservablePipes* may be found on the **[reference page](/docs/tags/observable-pipe/)**.

They are some of the most powerful tools in this library. However, it requires you to browse carefully through the documentation.
Some of these pipes are pretty complex to understand, **do not hesitate to play with them**, and take time to check the examples.
Finally, everytime you're facing a problem and want to implement your own ObservablePipe,
or if you're forced to perform some ugly trick, **there is probably an ObservablePipe** already existing and documented.
In this situation take a look at the [decision tree page](/docs/documentation/decision-tree/).
