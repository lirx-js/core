# What is an Observable ?

The following tutorial will teach you the basics: what is an Observable, an Observer, and what is the logic behind them.
We will start using only typing, to understand the essential concepts. The library's functions will be used later.

## Definition of an Observer

So, the first thing to do, is to define **what** is an [Observer](/docs/reference/observer/):

```ts
interface IObserver<GValue> {
  (value: GValue): void;
}
```

An *Observer* **is simply a function** that receives and consumes a value. Nothing more.
Its purpose is to **collect the values** sent by an *Observable*.

Here's an example of an *Observer* that logs its incoming values:

import ObserverExample from './_observer-example.mdx';

<ObserverExample/>

**Yes, it's just a function !** That's where `@lirx/core` shines: simplicity and efficiency.


Really simple, isn't it ?

## Definition of an Observable

An Observable is an **asynchronous stream of values**. We subscribe to it, and it will send us its data.

Let's define the [Observable](/docs/reference/observable/):

import ObservableTypes from '../../../reference/observable/_types.mdx';

<ObservableTypes/>


An *Observable* is a function that **receives an *Observer*** (used to **emit some values**, here through `emit`),
and **returns an *Unsubscribe*** function (used to free resources and notify the Observable to stop sending these values).

Here's a handmade example of an *Observable* that emits numbers (an incremented value) every 500ms:

import ObservableExample from './_observable-example.mdx';

<ObservableExample/>

To build our own Observable, we have to follow this pattern:

- create a function that receives an `emit` argument
- use `emit` to send some values
- and return a function which when called must free resources, and stop the Observable from sending values

`@lirx/core` already provides many functions to create plenty of Observables.
Usually you won't have to create them from scratch.

## Subscribing to an Observable using an Observer

To read the values of an Observable we just have to provide an Observer to it.
So we directly write:

```ts
const unsubscribe = observable(observer);
```

The Observable receives the Observer (the `emit` argument), and starts sending its values into this Observer.

Thus, in our example, it outputs:

```text
value: 0
value: 1
value: 2
value: 3
...
```

Later, when we want to dispose of the *Subscription*, we simply have to call the returned function (here `unsubscribe`):

```ts
unsubscribe(); // free resources, and stop to emit values
```

At this point, you may consider that it's pretty simple, and we've learned nothing:
we've just provided a callback to a function... nothing extraordinary.
This is where `@lirx/core` shines: it's simple by design, making it excessively fast and optimized by js engines.
But don't stop here, the **strength** of Reactive Programming is due to its **[piping possibilities](../what-is-an-observable-pipe)**.
