# What's next ?

To be efficient with `@lirx/core` (and Reactive Programming in general),
**you will have to take a look at many functions**.
If you **skip** this part, you'll definitively **struggle** with RP.

This may feel like a pain, but it's like any other framework: you'll be more productive if you **take an hour** (or a few) reading the documentation or some tutorials.

`@lirx/core` provides many functions to help you to build and pipe some Observables.
Everytime you **face a problem** with Observables, **there is probably an existing function** to fix it.
We recommend you to consult the **[decision tree page](/docs/documentation/decision-tree/)** in this case.
Usually, it will appear for Observables and cases you haven't encountered yet.
Moreover, you can find the list of all functions and types on the **[reference page](/docs/tags/)**.


Now, you can start to experiment by **yourself**, and build amazing applications around Observables.
**The only limit is your creativity**.

We hope, you've enjoyed the beauty of Reactive Programming, and I've been able to convert you to this incredible world.
It's not an easy road, but once mastered, it's pure pleasure.
