# Signal

## Fundamentals

A Signal is simply a function returning immediately its value (as opposed to an Observable whose value is only async):

```ts
interface IReadonlySignal<GValue> {
  (): GValue;

  [SIGNAL]: unknown;
}
```

This function is marked with the `SIGNAL` symbol so the framework can recognize signals and apply internal optimizations.

Signals are fundamentally read-only: we can ask for the current value and observe change notification.

### Read a signal

To read a signal, we simply have to call it like a function:

```ts
const value = count();
```

This function is used to access the current value *and* record signal read in a reactive context - this is an essential operation that builds the reactive dependencies graph.

Signal reads outside of the reactive context are permitted.
This means that non-reactive code (ex.: existing, 3rd party libraries) can always read the signal's value, without being aware of its reactive nature.


## Writable signals

When creating a Signal with the [signal](#create-a-signal) function (explained later), you'll receive a writable signal:

```ts
interface ISignal<GValue> extends IReadonlySignal<GValue> {
  set(value: GValue): void;

  update(updateFunction: ISignalUpdateFunctionCallback<GValue>): void;

  asReadonly(): IReadonlySignal<GValue>;
}
```

### set(...)

This method directly sets the Signal to a new value, and notifies any dependents.

This is useful for changing primitive values or replacing data structures when
the new value is independent of the old one.

### update(...)

This method updates the value of the Signal based on its current value, and notifies any dependents.

Useful for setting a new value that depends on the old value, such as updating an immutable data structure.

It accepts an `updateFunction`:

```ts
interface ISignalUpdateFunctionCallback<GValue> {
  (
    value: GValue,
  ): GValue;
}
```

`update` is simply a shorter and convenient manner to combine a signal read and write in one call (`count.update(c => c + 1)` is similar to `count.set(count() + 1)`).

## Create a Signal

An instance of a writable Signal can be created using the `signal` creation function:

```ts
function signal<GValue>(
  initialValue: GValue,
  options?: ICreateSignalOptions<GValue>,
): ISignal<GValue>
```

`initialValue` is used to set, as its name suggests, the signal's initial value.
Because signals are sync, this argument must be provided.

Then, it's possible to provide an optional `ICreateSignalOptions` argument:

```ts
interface ICreateSignalOptions<GValue> {
  readonly equal?: IEqualFunction<GValue>;
}

interface IEqualFunction<GValue> {
  (
    a: GValue,
    b: GValue,
  ): boolean;
}
```


- `equal`: this function is used to compare values passed to the `set` method.
If this equality function determines that 2 values are equal, then the value is simply ignored, and the change propagation is skipped.
- `EQUAL_FUNCTION_STRICT_EQUAL`: (default) - compares values using the strict equality `===`.
- `EQUAL_FUNCTION_NON_PRIMITIVES_ALWAYS_FALSE`: compares primitive values (numbers, strings, etc) using `===` semantics
but treats objects and arrays as "always unequal".
This allows Signals to hold non-primitive values (objects, arrays) and still propagate change notification.

## Examples

### Create a signal and set its value

```ts
// create a writable signal
const counter = signal(0);

// set a new signal value, completely replacing the current one
counter.set(5);

// update signal's value based on the current one
counter.update(currentValue => currentValue + 1);
```

### Create a signal with an immutable value

```ts
const names = signal<readonly string[]>(['Alice']);

// "update" is convenient to modify immutable data structures
names.update(names => ([
  ...names,
  'Bob',
]));
```

### Create a signal with a mutable array as value

```ts
// note that we MUST use a different `equal` function if we want to be able to mutate non-primitive values. Else the signal won't update.
const names = signal<string[]>(['Alice'], { equal: EQUAL_FUNCTION_NON_PRIMITIVES_ALWAYS_FALSE });

names.update(names => {
  names.push('Bob');
  return names;
});
```
