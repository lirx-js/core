# Effect

An effect is a side-effectful operation which reads the value of zero or more signals,
and is automatically scheduled to be re-run whenever any of those signals changes.

The basic API for an effect has the following signature:

```ts
function effect(
  effectFunction: IEffetFunction,
): IUnsubscribe;
```

```ts
interface IEffetFunction {
  (
    onCleanUp: IOnCleanUpFunction,
  ): void;
}

type IOnCleanUpFunction = IObservable<void>;
```

Usage example:

```ts
const firstName = signal('John');
const lastName  = signal('Doe');

// This effect logs the first and last names, and will log them again when either (or both) changes.
effect(() => console.log(firstName(), lastName()));
```

Effects have a variety of use cases, including:

- synchronizing data between multiple independent models
- triggering network requests
- performing rendering actions

Effect functions can, optionally, register a cleanup function.
If registered, cleanup functions will be executed before the next effect run.
The cleanup function makes it possible to "cancel" any work that the previous effect run might have started. Example:

```ts
effect((onCleanup) => {
  const countValue = count();

  let secsFromChange = 0;
  const id = setInterval(() => {
    console.log(
      `${countValue} had its value unchanged for ${++secsFromChange} seconds`
    );
  }, 1000);

  onCleanup(() => {
    console.log('Clearing and re-scheduling effect');
    clearInterval(id);
  });
});
```


#### Scheduling and timing of effects

Effects are **always executed after** the operation of changing a signal has completed.

Given the variety of effect use-cases, there is a wide spectrum of possible execution timings.
This is why **the actual effect execution timing is not guaranteed** and this framework might choose different strategies.
Application developers should not depend on any observed execution timing.
The only thing that can be guaranteed is that:

- effects will execute at least once
- effects will execute in response to their dependencies changes at some point in the future
- effects will execute minimal number of times: if an effect depends on multiple signals and several of them change at once, only one effect execution will be scheduled.

#### Stopping effects

An effect will be scheduled to run every time one of its dependencies change.
In this sense an effect is "always alive" and ready to respond to the changes in a reactive graph.
Such "infinite" lifespan is obviously undesired as **effects should be shut down** when an application stops (or some other life-scope ends).

Effects can be explicitly stopped / destroyed by calling the `IUnsubscribe` function returned from the effect creation:

```ts
// create an effect
const unsubscribeOfEffect = effect(() => {...});

// later on, explicitly destroy / stop this effect
unsubscribeOfEffect();
```

#### Effects writing to signals

We consider that **writing to signals from effects can lead to unexpected behavior** (mostly infinite loops) and hard to follow data flow.
As such any attempt of writing to a signal from an effect **is forbidden**:

```ts
const counter = signal(0);
const isBig = signal(false);

effect(() => {
  if (counter() > 5) {
    isBig.set(true); // throws
  } else {
    isBig.set(false); // throws
  }
});
```

> The framework is able to detect signal writes in effects, and will report an error.

Please note that `computed` is often a more declarative, straightforward and predictable solution to synchronizing data:

```ts
const counter = signal(0);
const isBig = computed(() => counter() > 5);
```

*If writes are still required*, and only if you perfectly know that you're not creating loops,
you may write to signals from effect using [queueMicrotask](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/queueMicrotask) or `setTimeout`:

```ts
const counter = signal(0);

effect(() => {
  if (counter() < 5) {
    setTimeout(() => counter.update(count => count + 1), 1000);
  }
});
```

#### Reading without tracking dependencies

Rarely, you may want to execute code which may read signals in a reactive function such as `computed` or `effect` *without creating a dependency*.

For example, suppose that when `currentUser` changes, the value of a `counter` should be logged.
Creating an effect which reads both signals:

```ts
effect(() => {
  console.log(`User set to `${currentUser()}` and the counter is ${counter()}`);
});
```

This example logs a message when either `currentUser` or `counter` changes.
However, if the effect should only run when `currentUser` changes, then the read of `counter` is only incidental and changes to `counter` shouldn't log a new message.

You can prevent a signal read from being tracked by calling its getter with `untracked`:

```ts
function untracked<GReturn>(
  callback: () => GReturn
): GReturn;
```

```ts
effect(() => {
  console.log(`User set to `${currentUser()}` and the counter is ${untracked(counter)}`);
});
```

`untracked` is also useful when an effect needs to invoke some external code which shouldn't be treated as a dependency:

```ts
effect(() => {
  const user = currentUser();

  untracked(() => {
    // if `store` uses some signals, they won't be tracked
    store.update(user);
  });
});
```

:::tip

It is important to note that `effect` may usually be replaced by `computed`, which is generally more adequate.
`effect` is sensitive to signal's loops, so dangerous operations should be avoided.
