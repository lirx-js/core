# Introduction

A *Signal* is the **sync** version of an Observable.
It contains a value that can be read at any time, and, just like Observables, it is capable of notifying interested consumers when that value changes.

A Signal is extremely similar to a [MulticastReplayLastSource](/docs/reference/create-multicast-replay-last-source/),
however, it works with specific functions designed especially for them (these functions do *magic stuff* to make signals appearing sync).

This usually **greatly simplify the design** of your applications.
However, this pattern is still in early stage and requires special attention to avoid misuse.

## Example

```ts
// create a writable signal
const counter = signal(0);

// create a computed signal
const isEven = computed(() => counter() % 2 === 0);

// computed properties are signals themselves
const color = computed(() => (isEven() ? 'red' : 'blue'));

// log the values of our signals, and log them again when either (or all) changes.
effect(() => {
  console.log('counter', counter(), 'isEven', isEven(), 'color', color());
});

// create an observable triggered on a click on the window
fromEventTarget(window, 'click')(() => {
  // update signal's value based on the current one
  counter.update((currentValue) => currentValue + 1);
});
```

## Advantages

#### Easier to use

As you may notice, using Signals **is usually easier than using Observables**.
Developers are generally used to *sync* code and development (ECMAScript even introduced *async/await* to mimic sync code).
In consequence, many of them usually struggle playing with pure *async* pieces of code,
causing rejection of great frameworks.

It's not a shame, Observables introduce a **very different approach** and manner of thinking,
that requires a lot of time and efforts to master.
Something that is not easy to learn or integrate, especially transitioning from pure *sync* code to pure *async* code.

To solve this issue, Signals help to bridge the gap between reactivity and *sync* code.
You get *sync* access, with *async* notifications to their observers.

#### Glitch free

The Observables are not [glitch-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming#Glitches) by nature.

Let's expose this with an example:

```ts
const [$counter, counter$] = let$$(0);

const isEven$ = map$$(counter$, (value) => value % 2 === 0);

const message$ = map$$(
  combineLatest([counter$, isEven$]),
  ([counter, isEven]) => `${counter} is ${isEven ? 'even' : 'odd'}`
);

message$(console.log);
$counter(1);
```

Running this example gives the output which shows the glitch:

```text
0 is even
1 is even
1 is odd
```

In asynchronous code, glitches are not typically an issue because async operations naturally resolve at different times.
However, in some case, these inconsistent intermediate results can have unwanted or dangerous consequences for the application
(like expensive and unnecessary operations, or soft lock).
This may be fixed in various ways, like using [function$$](/docs/reference/optimized-reactive-function/), but this is another discussion.

Because Signals are *sync*, they must be and **are glitch-free** in this implementation.


## Limits

#### Magic

Signals introduce some "magic" as their related functions have important side effects.

If not well understood, the Signals could be misused, which may lead to code with bugs hard to inspect and fix.

One common error consists of creating an unwanted "reactive loop": a signal `A` that updates another one, and from a hidden loop and chain of other Signals,
ends by updating the signal `A` itself. This causes an infinite loop of updates, usually crashing the application.

The framework is able to detect such loops and will report them as error instead of having an application crash.
However, it assumes that the developers are responsible to limit these cases and avoid signal's contexts having side effects.

In consequences, it is suggested to read carefully this tutorial to prevent "dangerous" practices or patterns.

#### Slightly less performant

Using Signals adds a little extra layer of complexity that slightly reduces performance against pure Observables.
So if performances are critical for you, you may consider using Observables only.
However, in most situations, you won't notice any performances' degradation.

#### Complement not replacement

Finally, Signals are a complement to the Observables, not a replacement.

A Signal is similar to a classic variable with the capacity to subscribe to its changes. Nothing more.

In consequence:

- to get *async* data (like mouse events, api fetch, etc.), you still want to use some Observables.
For exemple, using `fromFetch`, `fromAsyncIterable` or `fromEventTarget`.
- a Signal cannot be cancelled, because this is not a **pull** source (where the subscriber ask for data), but a **push** source (where an emitter send data).
So, if the data set into a Signal come from an async source, this source will have to be cancelled by yourself.

That means that is you have to play with stream of data, or purely async data, Observables are the proper answer.
