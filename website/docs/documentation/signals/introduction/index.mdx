# Introduction

A *Signal* is a wrapper around a value that **can notify interested consumers when that value changes**.
Signals can contain any value, from simple primitives to complex data structures.

A Signal's value is always read through a getter function, which allows the framework to track where the signal is used, and observe its changes.

Adopting Signals, will usually **greatly simplify the design** of your applications: if you have variables depending on other variables (called *computed variables*),
variables that mutates other time (called *dynamic variables*, ex: front-end framework updating the DOM), or state management (ak: `store`).

In addition, using Signals to hold dynamic values is easier that managing them yourself: updating manually your computed variables requires more code and quickly becomes error-prone,
where Signals handle it automatically.

Finally, they perfectly bridge the gap between imperative and reactive programming,
providing a smooth transition between two paradigms: you get the best of both worlds, with a simplified syntax, consistent application, and all of it without sacrificing on performances.

## Example

```ts
// create a writable signal
const counter = signal(0);

// create a computed signal
const isEven = computed(() => counter() % 2 === 0);

// computed properties are signals themselves
const color = computed(() => (isEven() ? 'red' : 'blue'));

// log the values of our signals, and log them again when either (or all) changes.
effect(() => {
  console.log('counter', counter(), 'isEven', isEven(), 'color', color());
});

// create an observable triggered on a click on the window
fromEventTarget(window, 'click')(() => {
  // update signal's value based on the current one
  counter.update((currentValue) => currentValue + 1);
});
```
