# Computed

Computed signals create derived values, based on one or more dependency signal values.
The derived value is updated in response to changes in the dependency signal values.
Computed values are not updated if there was no update to the dependent signals.

Example:

```ts
const counter = signal(0);

// creating a computed signal
const isEven = computed(() => counter() % 2 === 0);

// computed properties are signals themselves
const color = computed(() => isEven() ? 'red' : 'blue');
```

The signature of the computed is:

```ts
function computed<GValue>(
  computedFunction: IComputedFunction<GValue>,
  options?: IComputedOptions<GValue>,
): ISignal<GValue>
```

```ts
interface IComputedFunction<GValue> {
  (): GValue;
}

interface IComputedOptions<GValue> extends ISignalOptions<GValue> {
}
```

The computation function is expected to be side-effect free: it should only access values of the dependent signals
(and / or other values being part of the computation) and avoid any mutation operations.
In particular, the computation function should not write to other signals (the library's implementation will detect attempts of writing to signals from computed and raise an error).

Similarly to the writable signals, computed signals can (optionally) specify the equality function.
When provided, the equality function can stop recomputation of the deeper dependency chain if two values are determined to be equal. Example (with the default equality):

```ts
const counter = signal(0);

// creating a computed signal
const isEven = computed(() => counter() % 2 === 0);

// computed properties are signals themselves
const color = computed(() => isEven() ? 'red' : 'blue');

// providing a different, even value, to the counter signal means that:
// - isEven must be recomputed (its dependency changed)
// - color don't need to be recomputed (isEven() value stays the same)
counter.set(2);
```


The algorithm chosen to implement the computed functionality makes strong guarantees about the timing and correctness of computations:

- **Computations are lazy**: the computation function is not invoked, unless someone is interested in (reads) its value.
- **Computations are disposed of automatically**: as soon as the computed signal reference is out of scope
it is automatically eligible for garbage collection.
No explicit cleanup boundaries and / or operations are exposed by the library.
- **Computations are glitch-free*-like***: the computation function **may** be executed many times in response to dependencies change,
but the *sync* result will always be one expected.

#### Branching in Computations

Computed signals keep track of which signals were read in their computations, in order to know when recomputation is necessary.
This dependency set is dynamic, and self-adjusts with each computation.
So in the conditional computation:

```ts
const greeting = computed(() => showName() ? `Hello, ${name()}!` : 'Hello!');
```

The `greeting` will always be recomputed if the `showName` signal changes, but if `showName` is false,
the `name` signal is not a dependency of the `greeting` and will not cause it to recompute.
