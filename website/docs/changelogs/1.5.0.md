# 1.5.0 (unreleased)

- breaking: split IUnsubscribe

## What's new ?

### combineLatestObject

Add a new Observables builder: [combineLatestObject](/docs/reference/combine-latest/#combinelatestobject).

It's similar to `combineLatest` but works with `objects` instead.

### IReplayLastSource

Add a new `unsafe?: boolean` argument to the `getValue(...)` method of [IReplayLastSource](/docs/reference/replay-last-source/), to support *uninitialized value*.


## Performance

Signals have been considerably improved in performance (~x10 faster), thanks to various testing and fine optimizations. 

## Breaking changes

### Signals

#### Update default signal's equal function

The default signal's equal function is now `EQUAL_FUNCTION_STRICT_EQUAL` instead of `EQUAL_FUNCTION_NON_PRIMITIVES_ALWAYS_FALSE`

#### Changes in typing

- `IWritableSignal` becomes `ISignal`
- `ISignal` becomes `IReadonlySignal`
- some other interfaces or types

### sourceObservablePipe

The argument given to [sourceObservablePipe](/docs/reference/source-observable-pipe/) changes to allow a more generic pipe.

In consequence, its related pipes like [shareObservablePipe](/docs/reference/share-observable-pipe/) partially change too. 

However, this should be transparent as the change touches properties that was managed internally. 

### Remove reactiveString

After a 6 months period of `deprecated`.

### Remove logStateObservablePipe

After an 8 months period of `deprecated`.
