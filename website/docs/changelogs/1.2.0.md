# 1.2.0 (unreleased)

## What's new ?

### Add documentation to the RxJS's bridge

Add [a bridge](/docs/documentation/migration/from-rxjs/#bridge) between `@lirx/core` and `RxJS` to migrate step by step your existing projects.

Add the functions [fromRxJS](/docs/reference/from-rxjs/) and [toRxJS](/docs/reference/to-rxjs/)
to convert from an `rxjs`'s Observable to a `@lirx/core`'s one and vise-versa.

### Add IObservableLike and toObservable

Add the function [toObservable](/docs/reference/to-observable/).

It allows to convert an Observable or a value to an Observable.

## Deprecated

### Deprecate reactiveString

`reactiveString` was an experimental feature to create *reactive* strings from a specific string pattern,
and some Observables provided as `Record<string, IObservable<string>>`.
However, such a feature is not generic enough, and, if required, should exist as an independent library.

## Experimental

### Add experimental function autoUnsubscribeObservableWithNotifications

### Add experimental function cacheObservableWithNotifications

### Rework IOStream and WebSocketStream
