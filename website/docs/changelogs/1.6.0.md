# 1.6.0 (unreleased)

## Breaking changes

### Signals

Signals were fast, but they are even faster now âš¡.

They got major improvements in performance, but it has cost: some breaking changes and fewer checks at runtime.

Previously, Signals had checks to limit the risks that developers create *"reactive loop"* or side effects into signal's contexts (like `computed` or `effect`).
Now, we assume that developers are responsible to avoid such cases, and only the strict minimum is checked when using signals. 
This allows performances improvements, but we loose immediate feedback if a dangerous operation is done: like updating a signal's value into the `computed` or `effect` functions (spoiler: *don't do it* ðŸ˜…).

Previously, it was possible to force setting a new value within a Signal, bypassing the `equal` function (using `set(..., true)` or `mutate(...)`). 
We removed this functionally, granting this right only to the portion of code creating the signal (using the `equal` function), and not the one using it.

Finally, the `toObservable` started to be complicated having too many options. It is now a dedicated function (`fromSignal`) instead of a method.

In conclusion, Signals are now lighter and faster due to all these improvements.

#### Update the `set(...)` method

The `set` method now accepts a `SignalThrow` and the `force` argument is removed.

#### Remove the `mutate(...)` method

Now, only the creator of a signal can control how distinct values are managed through the `equal` function.

#### Remove the `toObservable(...)` method

This is replaced by the functions `fromSignal` and `fromSignalWithNotifications`.

#### Update the `effect(...)` function

Remove the `options` arguments.
